In the African savanna, a middle-aged barbarian woman and a young, rich celebrety actor is standing 20m from a police with his gun drawn and pointed at them.

  Police: Don't move!

  Actor: We're not moving.

  Police: What am I doing here?

  Actor: You got hit in the head by a lion.

  Police: You're lying!

  Barbarian (whispers to actor): What are you doing?

  Actor (whispers back): I have no idea what I'm doing!

  Police: I'm gonna shoot!

  Actor: Shoot who?

  Police: I don't know!

  Barbarian: Put your gun down, Mr police man.

  Police: Who the hell are you? And why are you dressed like that?
  
  Barbarian: I'm a barbarian!

  Police: A what?

  Barbarian: A barbarian.

  Police: OK, shut up right now, I tell you. This doesn't make any sense. Am I dreaming?

  Barbarian: You're not dreaming, Mr police man.

  Actor (whispers): Mr police man...

  Barbarian: Why don't you tell us what your name is?

  Police: My name? (Sweating, slight pause.) My name is Robert.

  Barbarian: That's good, Robert. What's the last thing you remember?

(Slight pause while zebras are running in the background.)

  Police: A helicopter?

  Actor (to himself): Those drugs are fucking amazing.

  Barbarian: What was in the helicopter?

  Police: My wife?

  Barbarian: That's right, Mr police man Robert. Your wife.

  Police: I am very confused!

  Actor: Put down your gun and we'll explain.

(Police throws his gun on the ground, in which instance the barbarian and actor immediately starts running the opposite direction.)

  Police: Hey! Hey, what's going on? Why are you running from me? I'll shoot! Where the hell is my gun...?

  Barbarian (to the actor while running): Well spoken, Mr pretender.

  Actor (panting): It's called "actor".

(A scream hears in the distance.)

  Actor: Run faster!

A gorilla in a helicopter is not an easy thing to handle. Two older CEOs sat on the opposite side of a soldier and this gorilla, both thinking the same thing: Why the hell did I agree to this?

Solider: Don't worry, we'll soon be there.

(CEO 1 nods.)

CEO 1 (to CEO 2): So this is a medical company?

(CEO 2 stays silent.)

CEO 1: (Nods) Yeah, I knew that. I knew it. (Stares at the gorilla. The gorilla stares back.) What's his name again?

Solider: Her name is Charlie.

CEO 1: Ah, it's a female. Charlie? Aha, aha.
